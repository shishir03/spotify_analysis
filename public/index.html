        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Spotify has an audio analysis feature that can extract various bits of information from a given song, such as its key and tempo.
            It also offers measurements of danceability, energy, and valence.
        </p>
        <p>
            From Spotify's website:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability,
                 beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, 
                loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing 
                to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Valence is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive 
                (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This website shows you those measurements for your top 50 tracks, and you can also search them up for any song you want by pasting in the link
            in the search bar. Have fun!
