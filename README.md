Spotify Analysis
======================

This is a website that displays the danceability, energy, and valence (positivity) of your top 50 songs. Alternatively, if you want to view the audio features of any song, you can paste the song link at the top.

Link: ~~https://spotify-feature-analysis.herokuapp.com/~~ (This link doesn't work for some reason. I'll fix it one of these days...)

Implementation
--------------------

Data on danceability, energy, and valence is acquired from the Spotify API. The data can be displayed in a sortable table or a graph, which uses d3.js, of each feature.

Future Tasks
-----------------

 - Add song art / artist name
 - Analyze the features of an entire playlist
 - Have the search bar use keywords instead of manually pasting in a link
 - Include graphs of correlation between the features in a scatterplot
